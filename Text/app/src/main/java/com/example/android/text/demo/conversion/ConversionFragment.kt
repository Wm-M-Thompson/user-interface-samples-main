/**
 * Search-as-you-type is a very useful feature when user wants to search for something quickly.
 * However, the feature cannot be easily implemented in non-alphabet based languages, such as
 * Japanese and Chinese.
 *
 * Android 13 introduces Conversion Suggestion API that allows apps to access pieces of text before
 * they are committed. With this API, apps can provide search-as-you-type feature in non-alphabet
 * languages.
